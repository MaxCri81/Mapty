# Mapty
A visual application that allows users to add their workouts and display them on a map. 

In this project, I utilized Leaflet for map rendering and the Local Storage API for data persistence. 
The JavaScript code is organized into different classes, with child classes inheriting methods and events delegated appropriately to ensure a clean and modular structure.

The project originated from a course. I developed the app based on the course material and implemented several enhancements to improve its functionality and overall user experience.
